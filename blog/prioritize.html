    <h1>Prioritize</h1>
    <p>What mean prioritize?
        In my opinion:
        
        In a simple way, Prioritize is think and do the most important tasks first
        
        In a Deep way to understand prioritize is in order to mental tools of physics like first principles: I have a specific energy and time limit for my body to work like think, breath, work out, do other things‚Ä¶ so prioritize is a better way to invest that energy to do tasks that are the most important enough to do first
        
        Why prioritize?
        Because is a better way to define approach investing your energy, time in important things to reduce the work time and space of what to do and more if you‚Äôre working on a Startup or you‚Äôre gonna found or creating Startup
        
        Why I‚Äôm prioritizing?
        I‚Äôm prioritizing because to realize what‚Äôs important, what matter more to do first to invest my time and energy in a better way
